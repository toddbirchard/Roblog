# Roblog Tumblr Theme

A Tumblr theme which manages itself autonomously. Posts are syndicated via automated integrations with services such as IFTTT, Zapier, Automate.io, Parabola, and others. Perfect for people who dont care about Tumblr but love backlinks.

## Post Types

* Hackernews
* Slashdot
* New York Times
* Pocket
* Medium
* Spotify
* Twitter
* Instagram
* JIRA

## Roadmap
There is some cleanup to be done but this project is being knocked down to a low priority. Tumblr's development tools and community truly suck.
