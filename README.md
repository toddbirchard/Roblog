A Tumblr theme which serves as an autonomous activity feed. Theme is best used in conjunction with third parties such as IFTTT, Zapier, Automate.io, Parabola, and others. Logic which determines post content is executed externally from this theme.

Perfect for people who dont care about Tumblr but love backlinks.
